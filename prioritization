# Security Findings Prioritization Standard
*Version 1.0 — Engineering Teams*

---

## Purpose
This document defines **how to prioritize and handle** security findings from all sources—SAST/SCA, Wiz, pentests, bug bounty, exposed secrets, etc. It provides a **standard method** for remediation prioritization without complex calculations.

**Who uses this:** Engineering teams, DevSecOps, Security Engineering, Compliance.

**Regulatory Basis:** [FedRAMP Rev 5 RA-5](https://www.fedramp.gov/documents/), [HITRUST CSF v11 10.p](https://hitrustalliance.net/product-tool/hitrust-csf/), [HIPAA §164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A)](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/rule/index.html)

## Priority Classes & What They Mean

| Priority | When to Use | SLA Source | What to Do |
|----------|-------------|------------|------------|
| **P0 — Incident-Treated** | • Active secret exposure<br/>• Confirmed data leakage<br/>• Bug bounty with working PoC | [FedRAMP IR-4](https://www.fedramp.gov/documents/), [HITRUST 09.v](https://hitrustalliance.net/product-tool/hitrust-csf/) | • Immediate containment<br/>• 24-hour response<br/>• Security team notification<br/>• Incident documentation |
| **P1 — Imminent Threat** | • [CISA KEV](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) listed CVE<br/>• Public exploit available<br/>• [EPSS ≥ 0.1](https://www.first.org/epss/) | [FedRAMP CM-4](https://www.fedramp.gov/documents/) | • 48-hour remediation<br/>• Emergency patch deployment<br/>• Security team escalation<br/>• Mitigation verification |
| **P2 — Critical** | • [CVSS ≥ 9.0](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3.1/specification-document)<br/>• Toxic combination creates critical risk <br/>• Critical SAST Findings | [FedRAMP RA-5](https://www.fedramp.gov/documents/) | • 7-day remediation<br/>• Security review required<br/>• Risk assessment<br/>• Remediation tracking |
| **P3 — High** | • [CVSS 7-8.9](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3.1/specification-document)<br/>• [EPSS 0.01-0.09](https://www.first.org/epss/)  <br/>• High SAST Findings  | [FedRAMP RA-5](https://www.fedramp.gov/documents/) | • 30-day remediation<br/>• Standard patch process<br/>• Security review<br/>• Progress monitoring |
| **P4 — Medium/Low** | Everything else | [FedRAMP RA-5](https://www.fedramp.gov/documents/) | • 90-day remediation<br/>• Regular maintenance<br/>• Quarterly review<br/>• Documentation updates |

## What "Incident-Treated" Means
**Not** a full incident response with SOC involvement. Instead:

### Lean Incident Response Process:
1. **Immediate Assessment** (within 1 hour)
   - Determine scope and impact
   - Identify affected systems/data
   - Assess potential data exposure

2. **Containment Actions** (within 4 hours)
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Revoke compromised credentials
   - Implement temporary mitigations

3. **Documentation & Notification** (within 24 hours)
   - Create incident ticket
   - Notify security team
   - Document initial findings

4. **Remediation & Verification** (within 7 days)
   - Implement permanent fixes
   - Verify remediation effectiveness
   - Update security controls

This satisfies [FedRAMP IR-4](https://www.fedramp.gov/documents/) and [HITRUST 09.v](https://hitrustalliance.net/product-tool/hitrust-csf/) requirements.

## Terminology & Compliance Implications

| Term | Definition | FedRAMP Implications | HITRUST Implications | HIPAA Implications | Audit Evidence Implications |
|------|------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Security Event** | Observable occurrence (alert, scan finding) | Must be logged and monitored | Requires event correlation | Breach notification triggers | Event logs, monitoring alerts |
| **Security Incident** | Event that jeopardizes confidentiality/integrity/availability | Incident response procedures required | Incident management framework | Breach assessment required | Incident reports, response documentation |
| **Vulnerability** | Weakness identified by assessment | High-risk vulnerabilities mitigated within thirty (30) days from date of discovery; moderate-risk vulnerabilities mitigated within ninety (90) days from date of discovery; low risk vulnerabilities mitigated within one hundred and eighty (180) days from date of discovery ([FedRAMP RA-5(d)](https://www.fedramp.gov/documents/)) | Vulnerability management program required | Risk analysis and mitigation required | Vulnerability scans, remediation tickets |
| **Finding** | Observable occurrence (alert, scan finding) | Must be tracked and remediated | Requires risk assessment | Security assessment required | Finding reports, remediation evidence |
| **Incident-Treated Finding** | High-risk finding handled via lean IR flow | Meets incident response requirements | Satisfies incident management | Meets breach assessment needs | Incident documentation, response timeline |

**Key Point:** Calling something an "incident" vs "finding" may affect reporting requirements and audit evidence needed.

## Remediation Workflow

### P0 - Incident-Treated Findings
```
Discovery → Immediate Assessment → Containment → Documentation → Remediation → Verification
```

### P1-P4 - Standard Findings
```
Discovery → Classification → Risk Assessment → Remediation Planning → Implementation → Verification → Documentation
```

---

## Compliance Requirements

### FedRAMP Requirements
- **RA-5**: Vulnerability scanning and assessment
- **CM-4**: Security impact analysis for changes
- **IR-4**: Incident handling procedures

### HITRUST Requirements
- **09.v**: Incident management
- **10.p**: Security monitoring

### HIPAA Requirements
- **§164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A)**: Security incident procedures
