Vulnerability Bucketing Framework for Large-Scale Environments

Managing hundreds of thousands of security findings across diverse sources (e.g., Wiz sensors, SAST, SCA, secrets in code, misconfigurations, penetration tests, bug bounty reports) requires a scalable, defensible, and actionable prioritization strategy. This framework provides a practical approach to bucketing vulnerabilities for remediation, leveraging industry-standard metrics and contextual risk factors.

Prioritization and Criteria

1. Imminent Threats (CISA KEV, Active Exploitation, PoE)

Criteria:
• CVSS >= 9.0 AND EPSS >= 0.7 AND Asset is externally accessible (internet-facing, public API, etc.) OR
• Active exploitation observed, including:
  - Inclusion in the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog
  - Evidence from other threat intelligence feeds (e.g., vendor advisories, security bulletins)
  - Confirmed, reproducible bug bounty submissions with Proof of Exploit (PoE) and known impact
  - Penetration test findings rated as Critical or High, or those demonstrating real attack paths, privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or business logic abuse

2. Wiz Toxic Combinations

Criteria:
• Multiple moderate/low findings or misconfigurations that, when combined, enable a critical attack path as identified by Wiz toxic combination analysis (e.g., privilege escalation + lateral movement + weak secrets + insecure configurations)
• Identified via Wiz's attack path and toxic combination features
• CVSS for individual findings or misconfigurations may be below 7.0, but the combination results in critical risk

3. Verified, Active Secrets

Criteria:
• Secrets (e.g., AWS keys, database credentials, API tokens) that have been verified as valid/active by a tool or process, and are accessible in code, configuration, or infrastructure
• Includes secrets confirmed as usable in production or externally accessible environments

4. Runtime Critical/High Vulnerabilities on Externally Accessible Assets

Criteria:
• CVSS >= 7.0 on externally accessible (internet-facing) production systems, APIs, or services
• Any vulnerability or misconfiguration (e.g., public storage, open management ports, overly permissive IAM roles) that could lead to external compromise of production assets
• Excludes vulnerabilities already classified as Imminent Threats, Verified, Active Secrets, or Wiz Toxic Combinations (see above)

5. SAST Critical/High Findings

Criteria:
• Critical or High severity findings from Static Application Security Testing (SAST) that do not meet the criteria for Imminent Threats or Wiz Toxic Combinations (i.e., not actively exploited, not CISA KEV, not part of a toxic combination)
• Includes RCE, SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass, etc.
• CVSS >= 7.0 where available

6. SCA Critical/High (Vulnerable Dependencies)

Criteria:
• Critical or High severity findings from Software Composition Analysis (SCA) that do not meet the criteria for Imminent Threats, Wiz Toxic Combinations, or EOL Software (i.e., not actively exploited, not CISA KEV, not part of a toxic combination, not end-of-life)
• Vulnerable third-party libraries, frameworks, or dependencies
• CVSS >= 7.0 where available

7. EOL Software and Unsupported Dependencies

Criteria:
• Third-party libraries, frameworks, or dependencies that have reached end-of-life and no longer receive security updates
• Software versions that are no longer supported by the vendor
• Components with known vulnerabilities that cannot be patched due to EOL status
• Prioritized by: age of EOL, external exposure, business criticality, number of affected applications

8. Runtime Critical/High Vulnerabilities on Non-Externally Accessible Assets

Criteria:
• CVSS >= 7.0 or given a High/Critical severity on non-externally accessible (not internet-facing) production systems that process sensitive data or support business functions
• Any vulnerability or misconfiguration (e.g., insecure internal storage, excessive permissions) that could lead to compromise of non-externally accessible assets
• Excludes vulnerabilities already classified as Imminent Threats, Verified, Active Secrets, Wiz Toxic Combinations, or Runtime Critical/High Vulnerabilities on Externally Accessible Assets (see above)

9. Runtime Medium/Low Vulnerabilities on Externally Accessible Assets

Criteria:
• CVSS 4.0-6.9 or moderate/low risk misconfigurations on externally accessible systems
• Any vulnerability or misconfiguration that could lead to compromise of externally accessible production assets
• Excludes vulnerabilities already classified as Imminent Threats, Verified, Active Secrets, Wiz Toxic Combinations, SAST Critical/High, SCA Critical/High, EOL Software, or Runtime Critical/High Vulnerabilities (see above)

10. Runtime Medium/Low Vulnerabilities on Non-Externally Accessible Assets

Criteria:
• CVSS 4.0-6.9 or moderate/low risk misconfigurations on non-externally accessible systems
• Any vulnerability or misconfiguration that could lead to compromise of non-externally accessible assets
• Excludes vulnerabilities already classified as Imminent Threats, Verified, Active Secrets, Wiz Toxic Combinations, SAST Critical/High, SCA Critical/High, EOL Software, or Runtime Critical/High Vulnerabilities (see above)

11. Secrets in Code in Production Environments

Criteria:
• Hardcoded credentials, API keys, tokens, or other secrets found in code, except those already meeting Imminent Threats or Verified, Active Secrets criteria (e.g., not verified as active/usable, not exposed externally, not enabling active exploitation)
• Includes general, unverified secrets that need triage/validation (e.g., pattern-matched passwords, unverified API keys)

12. Secrets in Code in Staging Environments

Criteria:
• Hardcoded credentials, API keys, tokens, or other secrets found in code, except those already meeting Imminent Threats or Verified, Active Secrets criteria (e.g., not verified as active/usable, not exposed externally, not enabling active exploitation)
• Includes general, unverified secrets that need triage/validation (e.g., pattern-matched passwords, unverified API keys)

13. Secrets in Code in All Remaining Environments

Criteria:
• Hardcoded credentials, API keys, tokens, or other secrets found in code, except those already meeting Imminent Threats or Verified, Active Secrets criteria (e.g., not verified as active/usable, not exposed externally, not enabling active exploitation)
• Includes general, unverified secrets that need triage/validation (e.g., pattern-matched passwords, unverified API keys)

14. Complex Remediation Required

Criteria:
• Vulnerabilities or misconfigurations requiring architectural changes
• Vendor patches not yet available
• Legacy system dependencies
• CVSS or EPSS may vary; prioritization based on remediation complexity

15. Deferred/Accepted Risk

Criteria:
• Vulnerabilities or misconfigurations with documented risk acceptance
• Compensating controls in place
• Business justification for deferral
• CVSS or EPSS may vary; prioritization based on risk acceptance process
