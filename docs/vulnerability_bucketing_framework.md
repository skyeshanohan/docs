# Vulnerability Bucketing Framework for Large-Scale Environments

Managing hundreds of thousands of security findings across diverse sources (e.g., Wiz sensors, SAST, SCA, secrets in code, misconfigurations, penetration tests, bug bounty reports) requires a scalable, defensible, and actionable prioritization strategy. This framework provides a practical approach to bucketing vulnerabilities for remediation, leveraging industry-standard metrics and contextual risk factors.

---

## Overview of Bucketing Approach

Findings are grouped into buckets based on a combination of:
- **CVSS/EPSS Scores**: Severity and exploitability
- **Toxic Combinations**: Multiple weaknesses or misconfigurations that together increase risk
- **External Exposure**: Internet-facing or accessible assets
- **Asset Criticality**: Business impact of affected systems
- **Active Threat Intelligence**: Evidence of exploitation in the wild
- **Regulatory/Compliance Impact**: Legal or contractual obligations

Each bucket is designed to be actionable and to focus remediation efforts where they will have the greatest risk reduction.

## Buckets and Criteria

### Imminent Threats (CISA KEV, Active Exploitation, PoE)
- **Criteria:**
  - CVSS >= 9.0 **AND**
  - EPSS >= 0.7 **AND**
  - Asset is externally exposed (internet-facing, public API, etc.) **OR**
  - **Active exploitation observed, including:**
    - Inclusion in the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog
    - Evidence from other threat intelligence feeds (e.g., vendor advisories, security bulletins)
    - Confirmed, reproducible bug bounty submissions with Proof of Exploit (PoE) and known impact
    - Penetration test findings rated as Critical or High, or those demonstrating real attack paths, privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or business logic abuse
    - Misconfigurations (e.g., public storage, open management ports, overly permissive IAM roles) that are actively exploited or included in CISA KEV or threat intelligence feeds

---

### Wiz Toxic Combinations
- **Criteria:**
  - Multiple moderate/low findings or misconfigurations that, when combined, enable a critical attack path as identified by **Wiz toxic combination analysis** (e.g., privilege escalation + lateral movement + weak secrets + insecure configurations)
  - Identified via Wiz's attack path and toxic combination features
  - CVSS for individual findings or misconfigurations may be below 7.0, but the combination results in critical risk

---

### Critical/High findings on External Production Assets
- **Criteria:**
  - CVSS >= 7.0 on internet-facing production systems, APIs, or services
  - Any vulnerability or misconfiguration (e.g., public storage, open management ports, overly permissive IAM roles) that could lead to external compromise of production assets
  - Excludes vulnerabilities already classified as Imminent Threats (see above)

---

### Critical/High on Internal Production Assets
- **Criteria:**
  - CVSS >= 7.0 on internal production systems that process sensitive data or support critical business functions
  - Any vulnerability or misconfiguration (e.g., insecure internal storage, excessive permissions) that could lead to compromise of sensitive internal assets
  - Excludes vulnerabilities already classified as Imminent Threats (see above)

---

### Critical/High on Development/Test Environments
- **Criteria:**
  - CVSS >= 7.0 on development, staging, or test environments
  - Any vulnerability or misconfiguration (e.g., open test environments, weak access controls) that could impact development or test systems
  - Excludes vulnerabilities already classified as Imminent Threats (see above)

---

### SAST Critical/High Findings
- **Criteria:**
  - Critical or High severity findings from Static Application Security Testing (SAST) that do not meet the criteria for Imminent Threats (i.e., not actively exploited, not CISA KEV, not on externally exposed assets, etc.)
  - Includes RCE, SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass, etc.
  - CVSS >= 7.0 where available

---

### SCA Critical/High (Vulnerable Dependencies)
- **Criteria:**
  - Critical or High severity findings from Software Composition Analysis (SCA) that do not meet the criteria for Imminent Threats (i.e., not actively exploited, not CISA KEV, not on externally exposed assets, etc.)
  - Vulnerable third-party libraries, frameworks, or dependencies
  - CVSS >= 7.0 where available

---

### Secrets in Code (By Environment)
- **Criteria:**
  - Hardcoded credentials, API keys, tokens, or other secrets found in code, except those already meeting Imminent Threats criteria (e.g., exposed in a way that enables active exploitation or external compromise)
  - Categorized by environment (production, development, test)

---

### Compliance-Driven (FedRAMP, HIPAA, PCI, etc.)
- **Criteria:**
  - Findings or misconfigurations that violate regulatory timelines or requirements
  - FedRAMP: Critical (30 days), High (30 days), Moderate (90 days), Low (180 days)
  - HIPAA: Affects ePHI systems
  - PCI DSS: Affects payment systems

---

### Medium/Low on High-Value Assets
- **Criteria:**
  - CVSS 4.0-6.9 or moderate/low risk misconfigurations on systems processing sensitive data (ePHI, PCI, PII)
  - Systems supporting critical business functions

---

### Medium/Low on Non-Critical Assets
- **Criteria:**
  - CVSS 4.0-6.9 or moderate/low risk misconfigurations on systems with minimal business impact
  - Development tools, non-production systems

---

### Complex Remediation Required
- **Criteria:**
  - Vulnerabilities or misconfigurations requiring architectural changes
  - Vendor patches not yet available
  - Legacy system dependencies
  - CVSS or EPSS may vary; prioritization based on remediation complexity

---

### Deferred/Accepted Risk
- **Criteria:**
  - Vulnerabilities or misconfigurations with documented risk acceptance
  - Compensating controls in place
  - Business justification for deferral
  - CVSS or EPSS may vary; prioritization based on risk acceptance process
