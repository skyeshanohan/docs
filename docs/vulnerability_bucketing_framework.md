# Vulnerability Bucketing Framework for Large-Scale Environments

Managing hundreds of thousands of security findings across diverse sources (e.g., Wiz sensors, SAST, SCA, secrets in code, misconfigurations, penetration tests, bug bounty reports) requires a scalable, defensible, and actionable prioritization strategy. This framework provides a practical approach to bucketing vulnerabilities for remediation, leveraging industry-standard metrics and contextual risk factors.

---

## Overview of Bucketing Approach

Findings are grouped into buckets based on a combination of:
- **CVSS/EPSS Scores**: Severity and exploitability
- **Toxic Combinations**: Multiple weaknesses or misconfigurations that together increase risk
- **External Exposure**: Internet-facing or accessible assets
- **Asset Criticality**: Business impact of affected systems
- **Active Threat Intelligence**: Evidence of exploitation in the wild
- **Regulatory/Compliance Impact**: Legal or contractual obligations

Each bucket is designed to be actionable and to focus remediation efforts where they will have the greatest risk reduction.

## Buckets and Criteria

### Imminent Threats (CISA KEV, Active Exploitation, PoE)
- **Criteria:**
  - CVSS >= 9.0 **AND**
  - EPSS >= 0.7 **AND**
  - Asset is externally accessible (internet-facing, public API, etc.) **OR**
  - **Active exploitation observed, including:**
    - Inclusion in the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog
    - Evidence from other threat intelligence feeds (e.g., vendor advisories, security bulletins)
    - Confirmed, reproducible bug bounty submissions with Proof of Exploit (PoE) and known impact
    - Penetration test findings rated as Critical or High, or those demonstrating real attack paths, privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or business logic abuse

---

### Wiz Toxic Combinations
- **Criteria:**
  - Multiple moderate/low findings or misconfigurations that, when combined, enable a critical attack path as identified by Wiz toxic combination analysis (e.g., privilege escalation + lateral movement + weak secrets + insecure configurations)
  - Identified via Wiz's attack path and toxic combination features
  - CVSS for individual findings or misconfigurations may be below 7.0, but the combination results in critical risk

---

### Verified, Active Secrets
- **Criteria:**
  - Secrets (e.g., AWS keys, database credentials, API tokens) that have been verified as valid/active by a tool or process, and are accessible in code, configuration, or infrastructure
  - Includes secrets confirmed as usable in production or externally accessible environments

---

### SAST Critical/High Findings
- **Criteria:**
  - Critical or High severity findings from Static Application Security Testing (SAST) that do not meet the criteria for Imminent Threats, Verified, Active Secrets, or Wiz Toxic Combinations (i.e., not actively exploited, not CISA KEV, not on externally accessible assets, not verified as active/usable, etc.)
  - Includes RCE, SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass, etc.
  - CVSS >= 7.0 where available

---

### SCA Critical/High (Vulnerable Dependencies)
- **Criteria:**
  - Critical or High severity findings from Software Composition Analysis (SCA) that do not meet the criteria for Imminent Threats, Verified, Active Secrets, or Wiz Toxic Combinations (i.e., not actively exploited, not CISA KEV, not on externally accessible assets, not verified as active/usable, etc.)
  - Vulnerable third-party libraries, frameworks, or dependencies
  - CVSS >= 7.0 where available

---

### EOL Software and Unsupported Dependencies
- **Criteria:**
  - Third-party libraries, frameworks, or dependencies that have reached end-of-life and no longer receive security updates
  - Software versions that are no longer supported by the vendor
  - Components with known vulnerabilities that cannot be patched due to EOL status
  - Prioritized by: age of EOL, external exposure, business criticality, number of affected applications

---

### Runtime Critical/High Vulnerabilities on Externally Accessible Assets
- **Criteria:**
  - CVSS >= 7.0 on externally accessible (internet-facing) production systems, APIs, or services
  - Any vulnerability or misconfiguration (e.g., public storage, open management ports, overly permissive IAM roles) that could lead to compromise of externally accessible production assets
  - Excludes vulnerabilities already classified as Imminent Threats, Verified, Active Secrets, Wiz Toxic Combinations, SAST Critical/High, SCA Critical/High, or EOL Software (see above)

---

### Runtime Medium/Low Vulnerabilities on Externally Accessible Assets
- **Criteria:**
  - CVSS 4.0-6.9 or moderate/low risk misconfigurations on externally accessible systems
  - Any vulnerability or misconfiguration that could lead to compromise of externally accessible production assets
  - Excludes vulnerabilities already classified as Imminent Threats, Verified, Active Secrets, Wiz Toxic Combinations, SAST Critical/High, SCA Critical/High, or EOL Software (see above)

---

### Runtime Critical/High Vulnerabilities on Non-Externally Accessible Assets
- **Criteria:**
  - CVSS >= 7.0 on non-externally accessible (not internet-facing) production systems that process sensitive data or support business functions
  - Any vulnerability or misconfiguration (e.g., insecure internal storage, excessive permissions) that could lead to compromise of non-externally accessible assets
  - Excludes vulnerabilities already classified as Imminent Threats, Verified, Active Secrets, Wiz Toxic Combinations, SAST Critical/High, SCA Critical/High, or EOL Software (see above)

---

### Runtime Medium/Low Vulnerabilities on Non-Externally Accessible Assets
- **Criteria:**
  - CVSS 4.0-6.9 or moderate/low risk misconfigurations on non-externally accessible systems
  - Any vulnerability or misconfiguration that could lead to compromise of non-externally accessible assets
  - Excludes vulnerabilities already classified as Imminent Threats, Verified, Active Secrets, Wiz Toxic Combinations, SAST Critical/High, SCA Critical/High, or EOL Software (see above)

---

### Secrets in Code in Production Environments
- **Criteria:**
  - Hardcoded credentials, API keys, tokens, or other secrets found in code, except those already meeting Imminent Threats or Verified, Active Secrets criteria (e.g., not verified as active/usable, not exposed externally, not enabling active exploitation)
  - Includes general, unverified secrets that need triage/validation (e.g., pattern-matched passwords, unverified API keys)
  - Categorized by environment (production, development, test)

  

---

### Secrets in Code in Staging Environments
- **Criteria:**
  - Hardcoded credentials, API keys, tokens, or other secrets found in code, except those already meeting Imminent Threats or Verified, Active Secrets criteria (e.g., not verified as active/usable, not exposed externally, not enabling active exploitation)
  - Includes general, unverified secrets that need triage/validation (e.g., pattern-matched passwords, unverified API keys)
  - Categorized by environment (production, development, test)

---

### Secrets in Code in All Remaining Environments
- **Criteria:**
  - Hardcoded credentials, API keys, tokens, or other secrets found in code, except those already meeting Imminent Threats or Verified, Active Secrets criteria (e.g., not verified as active/usable, not exposed externally, not enabling active exploitation)
  - Includes general, unverified secrets that need triage/validation (e.g., pattern-matched passwords, unverified API keys)
  - Categorized by environment (production, development, test)

---

### Complex Remediation Required
- **Criteria:**
  - Vulnerabilities or misconfigurations requiring architectural changes
  - Legacy system dependencies
  - CVSS or EPSS may vary; prioritization based on remediation complexity

---

### Deferred/Accepted Risk
- **Criteria:**
  - Vulnerabilities or misconfigurations with documented risk acceptance
  - Compensating controls in place
  - Business justification for deferral
  - CVSS or EPSS may vary; prioritization based on risk acceptance process
