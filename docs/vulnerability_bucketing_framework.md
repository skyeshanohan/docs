## Prioritization and Criteria

### Imminent Threats (CISA KEV, Active Exploitation, PoE)
- **Criteria:**
  - CVSS >= 9.0 **AND** EPSS >= 0.7 **AND** Asset is externally accessible (internet-facing, public API, etc.) **OR**
  - **Active exploitation observed, including:**
    - Inclusion in the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog
    - Evidence from other threat intelligence feeds (e.g., vendor advisories, security bulletins)
    - Confirmed, reproducible bug bounty submissions with Proof of Exploit (PoE) and known impact
    - Penetration test findings rated as Critical or High, or those demonstrating real attack paths, privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or business logic abuse

---

### Wiz Toxic Combinations
- **Criteria:**
  - Multiple moderate/low findings or misconfigurations that, when combined, enable a critical attack path as identified by Wiz toxic combination analysis (e.g., privilege escalation + lateral movement + weak secrets + insecure configurations)
  - Identified via Wiz's attack path and toxic combination features
  - CVSS for individual findings or misconfigurations may be below 7.0, but the combination results in critical risk

---

### Verified, Active Secrets
- **Criteria:**
  - Secrets (e.g., AWS keys, database credentials, API tokens) that have been verified as valid/active by a tool or process, and are accessible in code, configuration, or infrastructure
  

---

### Runtime Critical/High Vulnerabilities on Externally Accessible Assets
- **Criteria:**
  - CVSS >= 7.0 on externally accessible (internet-facing) production systems, APIs, or services

---

### SAST Critical/High Findings

---

### SCA Critical/High (Vulnerable Dependencies)

---

### EOL Software and Unsupported Dependencies

---

### Runtime Critical/High Vulnerabilities on Non-Externally Accessible Assets
- **Criteria:**
  - CVSS >= 7.0 or given a High/Critical severity on non-externally accessible (not internet-facing) production systems that process sensitive data or support business functions

---

### Runtime Medium/Low Vulnerabilities on Externally Accessible Assets
- **Criteria:**
  - CVSS 4.0-6.9 or moderate/low risk misconfigurations on externally accessible systems
---

### Runtime Medium/Low Vulnerabilities on Non-Externally Accessible Assets
- **Criteria:**
  - CVSS 4.0-6.9 or moderate/low risk misconfigurations on non-externally accessible systems

---

### Secrets in Code in Production Environments
- **Criteria:**
  - Hardcoded credentials, API keys, tokens, or other secrets found in code, except those already meeting Imminent Threats or Verified, Active Secrets criteria (e.g., not verified as active/usable, not exposed externally, not enabling active exploitation)
  - Includes general, unverified secrets that need triage/validation (e.g., pattern-matched passwords, unverified API keys)

---

### Secrets in Code in Staging Environments
- **Criteria:**
  - Hardcoded credentials, API keys, tokens, or other secrets found in code, except those already meeting Imminent Threats or Verified, Active Secrets criteria (e.g., not verified as active/usable, not exposed externally, not enabling active exploitation)
  - Includes general, unverified secrets that need triage/validation (e.g., pattern-matched passwords, unverified API keys)

---

### Secrets in Code in All Remaining Environments
- **Criteria:**
  - Hardcoded credentials, API keys, tokens, or other secrets found in code, except those already meeting Imminent Threats or Verified, Active Secrets criteria (e.g., not verified as active/usable, not exposed externally, not enabling active exploitation)
  - Includes general, unverified secrets that need triage/validation (e.g., pattern-matched passwords, unverified API keys)

---

### Complex Remediation Required
- **Criteria:**
  - Vulnerabilities or misconfigurations requiring architectural changes
  - Vendor patches not yet available
  - Legacy system dependencies

---

### Deferred/Accepted Risk
- **Criteria:**
  - Vulnerabilities or misconfigurations with documented risk acceptance
  - Compensating controls in place
  - Business justification for deferral
  - CVSS or EPSS may vary; prioritization based on risk acceptance process
