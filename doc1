## Executive Summary

The **Imminent Threat Security Process** is how we handle high-priority security findings that pose an immediate risk to the organization. We built this process to quickly detect, assess, and resolve critical vulnerabilities by working together with Engineering teams.

> üö® **Priority Clarification**: While Imminent Threats are high priority, **security incidents** (active breaches, ongoing attacks) are the **highest priority** and are handled by SOC/SIRT through the incident response process, not this workflow.

**What you need to know:**
- ‚ö° **High Priority**: These require immediate attention and dedicated resources
- ü§ù **We work together**: Security Architects and Engineering teams are partners in this
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Clear timelines**: 72 hours for action plans, 14 days for remediation
- üìä **We track everything**: Full visibility across all verticals and teams

## What is an Imminent Threat?

An **Imminent Threat** is a security finding that poses an immediate risk to the organization and needs urgent attention. These aren't your typical security issues‚Äîthey're real, exploitable vulnerabilities that could turn into major security incidents if we don't fix them quickly.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Imminent Threats are **NOT security incidents**. They are **preventive measures** to address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. Do not treat them as active breaches or security incidents.

### Why We Built This Process

- **Stop problems before they start**: Prevent security incidents before they happen
- **Move fast**: Standardized process for handling critical threats
- **Keep everyone accountable**: Clear ownership and tracking of security issues
- **Work better together**: Structured approach for Security and Engineering teams

---

## Identification Criteria

We consider a finding an **Imminent Threat** if it meets **any** of these criteria:

### 1. High-Severity Vulnerabilities
- **CVSS Score** ‚â• 9.0 **AND**
- **EPSS Severity** = HIGH or CRITICAL (0.65 - 1.0) **AND**
- **Asset Accessibility** = Externally accessible (Wide internet accessible) **AND**
- **CISA KEV** = Listed on CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog

### 2. Critical Wiz Toxic Combinations
- Specific high-risk combinations identified by our Wiz security platform

### 3. Penetration Test Findings
- **Severity**: High or Critical
- **Scope**: Existing services or infrastructure
- **Documentation**: Risk and impact are documented and realized
- **Proof of Exploit (PoE)**: Working PoE available (even if incomplete or potentially unstable)

### 4. Security Advisories
- Manual tickets created for critical security advisories

### 5. Bug Bounty Submissions
- **Status**: Confirmed exploitable
- **Documentation**: Proof of Exploit (PoE) and documented impact
- **Process**: Manual ticket creation

### 6. Verified Secrets in Code
- **Types**: AWS Keys, Azure Keys, and other sensitive credentials
- **Status**: Verified and validated as active/exposed

---

## Examples

**Here are real examples of Imminent Threats:**

### Example 1: Critical Vulnerability
- **Finding**: Log4j vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) on externally accessible web server
- **CVSS**: 10.0, **EPSS**: 0.97, **CISA KEV**: Yes
- **Action**: Immediate patching required within 14 days

### Example 2: Exposed Credentials
- **Finding**: AWS access keys found in public GitHub repository
- **Status**: Keys verified as active and have production access
- **Action**: Rotate keys immediately, implement secret scanning

### Example 3: Penetration Test Finding
- **Finding**: SQL injection vulnerability in customer portal
- **Severity**: Critical with working proof of exploit
- **Action**: Fix vulnerability and implement input validation

### Example 4: Bug Bounty Submission
- **Finding**: Remote code execution in API endpoint
- **Status**: Confirmed exploitable with documented impact
- **Action**: Patch vulnerability and add security controls

---

## What's In Scope

This process covers all findings that meet the criteria above, including:

- ‚úÖ **Automated Detection**: Wiz dashboard findings, security tool alerts
- ‚úÖ **Manual Detection**: Penetration test results, bug bounty submissions
- ‚úÖ **External Sources**: Security advisories, CISA KEV vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ **Code Security**: Exposed secrets and credentials
- ‚úÖ **Infrastructure**: Externally accessible assets with critical vulnerabilities

---

## What's Out of Scope

This process doesn't cover:

- ‚ùå **Routine Security Issues**: Standard vulnerability management items
- ‚ùå **Low/Medium Severity**: Findings below the CVSS/EPSS thresholds
- ‚ùå **Internal-Only Assets**: Systems not externally accessible
- ‚ùå **Non-Exploitable**: Findings without working proof of concept
- ‚ùå **Security Incidents**: Active breaches (handled by SOC/SIRT)

> üö® **CRITICAL DISTINCTION**: If a finding is determined to be an **active security incident** (actual breach, ongoing attack, or confirmed exploitation), it will be escalated to SOC/SIRT and handled through the incident response process, NOT through this Imminent Threat process.

---

## Engineering Team Responsibilities

When your team gets assigned an Imminent Threat ticket, here's what you need to do:

### 1. Initial Response (Within 72 Hours)
1. **Acknowledge** the ticket assignment.
2. **Review** the finding details and impact assessment.
3. **Engage** with the assigned Security Architect for context.
4. **Provide** detailed impact assessment including:
   - Business impact
   - Technical impact
   - Affected systems and users
   - Current mitigations in place

### 2. Action Plan Development (Within 72 Hours)
- **Create** and submit an action plan using one of these approaches:

**Option A: Remediation**
- Complete fix that eliminates the vulnerability
- This is what we prefer when it's technically feasible
- Must be implemented within 14 days

**Option B: Mitigating Controls**
- Temporary measures to reduce risk
- Must be implemented immediately for working PoE
- You still need a permanent fix within 14 days

**Option C: Exception**
- Formal request to accept the risk
- Requires GRC review and approval
- Must include business justification

**Option D: Risk Acceptance**
- Acknowledgment of risk with business approval
- Requires GRC review and approval
- Must include risk mitigation strategies

### Action Plan Template

Use this template when submitting your action plan:

```
**Finding**: [Brief description of the vulnerability]

**Impact Assessment**:
- Business Impact: [How this affects the business]
- Technical Impact: [Technical details and scope]

```

### 3. Implementation and Tracking
1. **Execute** the approved action plan.
2. **Update** the ticket regularly with progress.
3. **Communicate** any blockers or delays immediately.
4. **Provide** evidence of completion.

### 4. How to Work Well Together

### Escalation Timeline
- **72 Hours**: No action plan started ‚Üí We escalate to SVP of vertical
- **14 Days**: No remediation completed ‚Üí We keep tracking and reporting

---

## Process Flow

Here's how the Imminent Threat process works at a high level:

### 1. **Detection & Ticket Creation**
1. Finding gets identified (automatically or manually).
2. Ticket created in EIS Jira Project with proper labels.
3. Auto-assigned to Security Architect by vertical.

### 2. **Initial Assessment**
1. Security Architect does quick threat modeling.
2. **If it's an active security incident**: Escalated to SOC/SIRT (not handled here).
3. **If it's an imminent threat**: Continues with preventive action.

### 3. **Team Engagement & Planning**
1. Security Architect reaches out to affected team.
2. Team provides impact assessment and context.
3. Team develops and submits action plan (remediation, mitigation, exception, or risk acceptance).

### 4. **Review & Implementation**
1. Security Architect reviews and approves the plan.
2. Team implements the approved solution.
3. Security Architect tracks progress and confirms resolution.

### 5. **Closure**
1. Once resolved, Security Architect documents and closes the ticket.

> üîç **Key Decision Point**: The Security Architect determines if this is an active security incident (goes to SOC) or an imminent threat requiring preventive action (continues in this process).

## Escalation Procedures

### When We Escalate
- **72 Hours**: No action plan submitted
- **14 Days**: No remediation completed
- **Repeated Delays**: Pattern of missed deadlines

### Escalation Path
1. **Security Architect** escalates to Engineering Manager.
2. **Engineering Manager** escalates to Director/VP.
3. **Director/VP** escalates to **SVP of Vertical**.
4. **SVP of Vertical** escalates to Executive Leadership.

### What Happens When We Escalate
- **Immediate Attention**: Senior leadership gets involved
- **Resource Allocation**: We may assign additional resources
- **Priority Adjustment**: Other work may get deprioritized
- **Documentation**: We track all delays and reasons

---

## Tracking and Reporting

### Jira Project Details
- **Project**: EIS Imminent Threat
- **Labels**: `imminent-threat`, `source-[tool]`, `vertical-[team]`
- **Automation**: We auto-assign by vertical/team

### How We Track and Monitor
We track imminent threat tickets for SLA compliance at multiple levels:

#### **Tickets Above SLA**
- All tickets unresolved past 14-day remediation SLA
- We report these by vertical, pod, and source system
- Flagged for immediate attention

#### **Tickets Without Action Plan Over SLA**
- Tickets lacking approved action plan after 72 hours
- We track and highlight these by vertical, pod, and source system
- Immediate escalation required

#### **Source System Tracking**
- Each ticket gets tagged with originating source system
- This lets us do reporting and trend analysis by source
- Examples: Wiz, Pentest, Bug Bounty, Security Advisory

#### **Regular Reporting**
- **Monthly**: Current status and SLA compliance
- **Quarterly**: Trends and recurring issues
- **Yearly**: Comprehensive metrics and improvements

### Key Metrics Tracked
- Number of tickets created, resolved, and closed
- Percentage of tickets resolved within SLA
- Number and percentage of tickets breaching SLA
- Trends and recurring issues by vertical, pod, and source system

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**‚ùå Don't do these things:**

- **Wait until the last minute** to start working on the action plan
- **Ignore the Security Architect** - they're here to help, not to blame
- **Submit incomplete action plans** without proper impact assessment
- **Assume the fix is simple** without proper testing and validation
- **Forget to communicate blockers** - speak up early if you need help
- **Skip the rollback plan** - always have a way to undo changes
- **Treat this like a regular bug** - this is high priority and needs immediate attention

**‚úÖ Do these things instead:**

- **Start immediately** when you get the ticket assignment
- **Engage with the Security Architect** early and often
- **Provide detailed impact assessments** with business context
- **Test your fixes thoroughly** before marking as complete
- **Communicate proactively** about any issues or delays
- **Document everything** for audit and learning purposes
- **Ask questions** if you're unsure about anything

## FAQ

### **Q: What if I disagree with the severity assessment?**
A: Talk to the Security Architect right away. Give them additional context and technical details. We can revise the assessment based on new information.

### **Q: Can I request an extension to the 14-day SLA?**
A: Extensions are possible but you need strong business justification and approval from the Security Architect and your Engineering Manager. Document the reasons clearly.

### **Q: What if the fix requires significant architectural changes?**
A: Work with the Security Architect to develop a phased approach. Temporary mitigations might be okay while you implement the permanent solution.
 
### **Q: How do I know if my finding qualifies as an Imminent Threat?**
A: The Security Architect will make this call during the initial assessment. If you're unsure, err on the side of caution and talk to Security.

### **Q: What's the difference between an Imminent Threat and a Security Incident?**
A: **Imminent Threats** are preventive measures for vulnerabilities that could be exploited. **Security Incidents** are active breaches, ongoing attacks, or confirmed exploitation. If you suspect an active incident, contact SOC/SIRT immediately - do not use this process.

### **Q: What happens if I miss the 72-hour action plan deadline?**
A: We'll escalate the ticket to your SVP of vertical. It's critical to communicate any blockers immediately to avoid escalation.

### **Q: Can I work on multiple Imminent Threats simultaneously?**
A: Yes, but make sure you have adequate resources and communicate capacity constraints to the Security Architect early.

### **Q: What if the fix breaks something else?**
A: Implement proper testing and rollback procedures. If issues come up, communicate immediately with the Security Architect to adjust the approach.

### **Q: How do I provide evidence of completion?**
A: Include screenshots, logs, test results, or other documentation that shows the vulnerability has been properly addressed.

## Important Reminders

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Remember**: This process is designed to protect the organization, not to assign blame. We're all working together to keep things secure.

> üö® **CRITICAL**: Imminent Threats are **NOT security incidents**. They are preventive measures to address vulnerabilities before exploitation occurs.

> üöÄ **Act Fast**: Imminent threats require immediate attention. Don't delay in reaching out to the Security Architect.

> üìû **Communicate Early**: If you run into any blockers or need additional resources, communicate immediately rather than waiting for deadlines.

> üìã **Document Everything**: Keep detailed records of your actions, decisions, and progress for audit and learning purposes.

> üîÑ **Process Distinction**: If you discover an active security incident (breach, ongoing attack), contact SOC/SIRT immediately - don't use this Imminent Threat process.
