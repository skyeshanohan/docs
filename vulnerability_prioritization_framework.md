# Vulnerability Prioritization Framework

## Overview

This framework provides a clear, hierarchical approach to vulnerability prioritization based on tangible factors without complex calculations or weights.

## Urgent Classification

**Urgent** findings require immediate action (what does this look like from a tracking perspective).

### Urgent Criteria (ALL must be true):

1. **Active Exploitation** - One of:
   - Listed in CISA KEV catalog
   - Confirmed active exploitation in the wild
   - Working exploit with evidence of successful attacks

2. **Direct Attack Path** - One of:
   - Internet-facing with public access
   - Internal system with lateral movement potential to internet-facing systems
   - Authentication bypass or privilege escalation

3. **Production Impact** - One of:
   - Production environment
   - Customer-facing application
   - Contains sensitive data (PII, PHI, financial)

## Prioritized List

**Note**: This general risk-based order of precedence should be followed unless there is an urgent priority event occurring.

### 1. CISA KEVs with fix available
- Any and all findings regardless of SLA status or severity rating

### 2. End-of-Life/End-of-Support Software
- Any and all findings regardless of SLA status or severity rating

### 3. Toxic combinations with public exposure
- Multiple vulnerabilities that create attack chains + public exposure + fix available

### 4. Public-Internet facing Critical/High CVSS with EPSS > 0.5
- Public exposure + Critical/High severity + medium/high exploit probability + fix available

### 5. Public-Internet facing Critical/High CVSS with public exploit
- Public exposure + Critical/High severity + known public exploit + fix available

### 6. Toxic combinations in production environment
- Multiple vulnerabilities that create attack chains + production environment + fix available

### 7. Production Environment Critical/High CVSS with EPSS > 0.5
- Production environment + Critical/High severity + medium/high exploit probability + fix available

### 8. Public-Internet facing Medium/Low CVSS with EPSS > 0.5
- Public exposure + Medium/Low severity + medium/high exploit probability + fix available

### 9. All other findings with fix available
- Everything else with a fix available

### 10. All other findings without fix available
- Everything else without a fix available
